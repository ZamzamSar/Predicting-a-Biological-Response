    "As the chemical preparties of the different macules affect the biological response of these molecules which results in affecting the final product made by these molecules. Studying the biological activity of molecules using the test and trail can be costly in time and effort. Using the benefit of ML we are going to predict the biological activity response of different molecules based on their chemical preparties.\n",
